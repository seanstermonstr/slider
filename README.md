Slider Game
This is a basic slider game that allows for several modes of play.  The user can decide how large 
he wants the grid to be, as well as how he wants it randomized.  The game is capable of producing 
a grid which is generated randomly, as well as a solved grid that is then shuffled an amount of times.  
If the user picks the first option, there is the chance that it will produce an unsolvable puzzle,
however the randomization is better.  The second option provides less complete randomization, 
but it will produce a solvable puzzle.
